# MERN Boilerplate

So I've been copy pasting the entire backend stack that I created and used in [https://github.com/diope/drybbble](Drybbble) as I didn't want to redo it each time I wanted to mess around with an idea of sorts that needed authentication so I decided to create a boilerplate and rework the backend to better separate concerns and make it more modular.

In its current implementation this boilerplate supports:
* MongoDB
* JWT
* Authentication with basic Authorization (you can define routes a user is authorized to visit)

I plan to keep toiling at this as I plan to use it as my base going forward.
